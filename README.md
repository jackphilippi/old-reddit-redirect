# Old Reddit Viewer

Old Reddit Viewer is a Firefox extension that redirects users from the new version of Reddit (www.reddit.com) to the old version (old.reddit.com).

## Description

The Old Reddit Viewer extension provides an easier way to view Reddit using the old layout. When installed, the addon will display a modal on all reddit urls containing `www.reddit.com` and provides a button to redirect to `old.reddit.com`


## Installation

To install the Old Reddit Viewer extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your Firefox browser.
2. Visit the [Old Reddit Viewer extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-reddit-viewer/).
3. Click the "Add to Firefox" button.
4. Wait for the installation to complete.
5. The Old Reddit Viewer extension is now installed and ready to use.

## Usage

Once the Old Reddit Viewer extension is installed, simply visit any Reddit page using the new layout (`www.reddit.com`) and it will provide you a modal and a button to redirect you to the old layout (`old.reddit.com`). You can browse and interact with Reddit as you normally would, but with the classic Reddit interface.
